Reports are generated in the /reports folder.

For developers
================

To add plugins to format the report add it to the plugins directory and update
the config.py file. Dont forget to lint your codes using the flake8 linter (
http://flake8.readthedocs.org/en/2.2.3/) by running "flake8 ." in the folder
and ensure that there are no errors.
